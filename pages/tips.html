        <h2 class="tip">Use reusable water bottles/cups</h2>
        <p>Most coffee shops will fill your reusable cup and some even give a discount. Using a reusable water bottle will also save you money instead of regularly buying new bottles.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="tip">Avoid single-use containers and plastics</h2>
            <p>Keep a set of silverware and reusable food containers at work or in your car that you can use when needed and wash and reuse.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="tip">Purchase wisely and choose paperless billing</h2>
            <p>Buy products that come with less packaging and/or packaging that can be recycled. Paperless billing also greatly curbs excess paper use.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="tip">Buy secondhand and donate used items</h2>
            <p>This often supports local charities and saves items from ending up in the dump. You can also join local buy-and-sell groups, such as your neighborhood Buy Nothing Facebook group.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="tip">Buy in bulk and shop with reusable bags</h2>
            <p>Buying in bulk (as long as the food does not go to waste) and using your own reusable containers and bags greatly reduces packaging waste.</p>
